# Ethdam - Trail of Bits

During [EthDam](https://www.ethdam.com/), up to $2k are to be the won for the best project(s) using [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) (see [ethdam hackathon rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wpQ7XYZE5wTUW5wRCzHPaHNYfsh16xUPwf6WvlbuZlc/edit#heading=h.mzzlyq3xgrer)) 

## Ressources

## Themes

We look for projects exploring one of these themes:

- UX/UI: leverage slither through an interfaces. Ex:
  - TBD 
- On-chain monitoring (aka [slither-read-storage](https://github.com/crytic/slither/blob/master/slither/tools/read_storage/README.md) on steroids). Ex:
  - Show the state variables evolution over time/block number
  - Show the contract relationship (caller, called, what functions are called, etc)
- Machine learning & slither. Ex: 
  - Build a RAG with langchain to do code understand / QA bot on solidity
  - Use LLM to enhance the detectors filtering

You do not need to follow the examples provided, we are also looking for ideas and exploratory projects.


## Judging critera

- Novelty
- Reliance on slither (the more the project extends and uses slither, the better)

## Submission process

TBD

## Requirements

- Python
